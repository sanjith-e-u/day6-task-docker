# Docker Task - Day 6 ðŸš€

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
On Day 6, I focused on learning and implementing:

- **Docker Volumes**:
  - Persist container data even after container removal
  - Mounted a volume from host to container for log storage

- **Docker Networks**:
  - Created a custom bridge network for inter-container communication
  - Ensured services are isolated and securely connected

- **Docker CLI Commands Practiced**:
  - `docker volume ls`
  - `docker network ls`
  - `docker-compose up`
  - `docker-compose down`
